Optimal transport (OT) offers a robust framework for comparing probability distributions, significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground distance metric. Supervised metric learning within OT can leverage labeled data to enhance task-specific outcomes, but existing methods are only limited to learning a metric between a pair of distributions. Furthermore, they lack interpretability, essential for fields like biology, medicine and finance. This paper introduces a novel approach to supervised metric learning in OT across populations, emphasizing interpretability by constraining the hypothesis space to highlight feature importance. Our method allows features across different modalities, providing a comprehensive view of their relative importance. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world data that our approach maintains competitive performance while significantly improving interpretability.
